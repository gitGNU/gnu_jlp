/**
 * <p>
 * A solver instance, representing a problem (with data, constraints), a set of parameters for solving the problem, and
 * possibly after having been run, a feasible solution. The solver abstracts several commercial and free solvers such as
 * lp_solve, CPLEX, etc., and thus relies on a solver implementation called the underlying solver.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The solver may be run several times. It remembers its bound problem and parameters between runs. Elements may be
 * changed in between runs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The solver also offers a possiblity for the user to mess manually with the underlying solver, that can be used to
 * access advanced functionalities not offered by the wrapper (but please consider rather adding the functionality to
 * the wrapper itself if it makes sense, or introduce a bug report to that effect). However, this possibility must be
 * used with caution. After the underlying solver is retrieved by the user, this solver does not update its content any
 * more (to avoid erasing manually introduced changes). Hence, calling {@link #getUnderlyingSolver()} then modifying the
 * bound problem is forbidden. Although this is currently not enforced, the user <em>should not</em> modify this solver
 * state through the parameters or the problem views after a call to {@link #getUnderlyingSolver()}. The caller must not
 * forget to {@link #close()} the solver after use when using it manually, except that the methods {@link #solve()} and
 * {@link #writeProblem(LpFileFormat, String, boolean)} close the underlying solver after the job is done, thus it is
 * not necessary to call close again after these calls. After a call to {@link #solve()} or
 * {@link #writeProblem(LpFileFormat, String, boolean)}, the underlying solver pointer is not valid any more.
 * 
 * TODO make {@link #getUnderlyingSolver()} bring this object to an immutable state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When a problem is transferred to the underlying solver by this solver, the variables having a type of
 * {@link LpVariableType#BOOL} are associated with 0 and 1 lower and upper bounds except if their associated bounds are
 * even further constrainted. E.g. a variable defined as BOOL with bounds of <0.5, 4> have its bounds modified to become
 * <0.5, 1> for the underlying solver. However this object will report the bounds as they are set in the problem, thus
 * with bounds of <0.5, 4>. Also note that the solver does not attempt to transform the input in a manner dependent on
 * the underlying solver. If, for example, a 0-1 binary solver is used, the bounds are <em>not</em> automatically
 * transformed to conform to this setting. (Thus in that situation the solver will throw an exception when attempted to
 * solve.) An undefined bound is equivalent to a minus, or plus, infinity. This is so, once again, independently of the
 * underlying solver. This permits to ensure that the same problem is solved independently of the chosen underlying
 * solver. An automatic transformation is done in cases it does not modify the problem, e.g. if the underlying solver
 * requires integer bounds for integer variables, the bounds will be set accordingly (e.g. transforming a lower bound of
 * 2.5 to a lowerbound of 3) because this has no impact on the set of feasible solution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The type of the objects used for the variables should have their {@link #equals(Object)} method implemented in a
 * meaningful way as this is used when retrieving the values, and their {@link #hashCode()} method should be correctly
 * implemented. The variables should be immutable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise specified in the documentation of specific solvers, the solution returned by {@link #getSolution()}
 * is set with the exact values returned by the solver, i.e. no attempt is made to be clever and change the returned
 * solution values. E.g. if the optimal value is not returned by the underlying solver, it is not set in the solution,
 * although it could possibly be deduced from the variable values and the objective function. Also no attempt is made to
 * round supposedly integer results. This allows the user to manually take into account the numerical imprecision of the
 * solver used.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note about unconstrained variable: it is admitted to include variables that are used in no constraints in a problem.
 * Such a variable may have bounds. This solver does not take action: if the underlying solver gives a solution
 * (therefore chosen arbitrarily), it will appear as a solution. Forcing, with this solver, no solution for such a
 * variable would be appropriate only if the variable has no bound. If it has, then a solution should be given to avoid
 * exhibiting a different behavior between a bound on a variable and a constraint expressing the same bound.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Problems may be solved without an objective function, in which case the solve will simply search for a feasible
 * solution. In this case it never returns the status {@link LpResultStatus#OPTIMAL}. When solve is called, the bound
 * problem must have its objective function defined iff the objective direction is defined. Defining one and not the
 * other one is useless and considered as an error.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Solving a problem with no constraints (and even no variables) is allowed and results in a
 * {@link LpResultStatus#FEASIBLE} status.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As some solvers (notably CPLEX) sometimes yield a solution that is slightly outside the defined bounds for the
 * variable, this solver may be set to automatically correct such discrepancies when the difference between the bound
 * and the observed solution does not exceed a threshold defined by the user. See
 * {@link #setAutoCorrectThreshold(Double)}.
 * </p>
